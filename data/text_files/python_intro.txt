Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum
and first released in 1991.

Python is known for its simple and readable syntax, which makes it a popular choice
for beginners as well as experienced developers.

The language supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in web development,
data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and scientific computing.
