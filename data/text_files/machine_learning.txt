Machine learning is a field of computer science that focuses on building systems
that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being
explicitly programmed.

It is a core subfield of artificial intelligence and is commonly used in applications
such as recommendation systems, image recognition, speech recognition, and fraud detection.

Machine learning algorithms are typically categorized into supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
